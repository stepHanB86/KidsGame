# **Kids Game in Python with Pygame**



This project is a simple game for children developed with Pygame. It was created as part of my retraining, with my focus on applying what I have learned in practice.



## **Project Status**

The game is functional, but some features are still in development or need improvement.

There are some bugs that still need to be fixed.

The functions for spawning objects and other mechanics should be converted into classes to make the code more maintainable and readable.

New features and improvements are planned.



## **Installation**

To run the game, you need Python and Pygame. Install the required dependencies with:

pip install pygame

Start the game with:

python main.py



## **Planned Improvements**

Refactoring: Converting functions into classes

Bug fixing

Expanding the game with new features




## **I appreciate any feedback and suggestions for improvement!**
